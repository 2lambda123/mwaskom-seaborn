v0.9.0 (Unreleased)
-------------------

- Added the :func:`scatterplot` function for representing the relationship between ``x`` and ``y``, potentially after conditioning on up to three other variables and semantically mapping those conditions with the color, size, or style of the points.

- Added the :func:`lineplot` function for representing relationships between``x`` and ``y`` variables with lines, potentially after conditioning on up to three other variables and semantically mapping those conditions with the color, size, or style of the lines. This function replaces :func:`tsplot`, but with an API that is more consistent with other modern seaborn functions and has both more flexibility (more dimensions of semantic mapping, better handling of dates) and less flexibility (fewer options for visual representing uncertainty). There is considerable new API documentation and a few gallery examples.

- Final removal of the previously-deprecated ``coefplot`` and ``interactplot`` functions.

- Deprecated the statistical annotation component of :class:`JointGrid`. The method is still available but will be removed in a future version.

- Updated the seaborn palettes ("deep", "muted", "colorblind", etc.) to correspond with the new 10-color matplotlib default. The legacy palettes are now available at "deep6", "muted6", "colorblind6", etc. Additionally, a few individual colors were tweaked for better consistency, aesthetics, and accessibility.

- Calling :func:`color_palette` (or :func:`set_palette`) with a named qualitative palettes (i.e. one of the seaborn palettes, the colorbrewer qualitative palettes, or the matplotlib matplotlib tableau-derived palettes) and no specified number of colors will return all of the colors in the palette. This means that for some palettes, the returned list will have a different length than it did in previous versions.

- Reorganized and updated some :func:`axes_style`/:func:`plotting_context` parameters to take advantage of improvements in the `matplotlib2 update <https://matplotlib.org/users/dflt_style_changes.html>`_. The biggest change involves using several new params in the "style" spec while moving parameters that used to implement the corresponding aesthetics to the "context" spec. For example, axes spines and ticks are now off instead of having their width/length zeroed out for the darkgrid style. That means the width/length of these elements can now be scaled in different contexts. The effect is a more cohesive appearance of the plots, especially in larger contexts. These changes include only minimal support for the 1.x matplotlib series. Users who are stuck on matplotlib 1.5 but wish to use seaborn styling may want to use the seaborn parameters that can be accessed through the `matplotlib stylesheet interface <https://matplotlib.org/users/style_sheets.html>`_.

- Slightly increased the base font sizes in :func:`plotting_context` and increased the scaling factors for ``"talk"`` and ``"poster"`` contexts.

- Calling :func:`set` will now call :func:`set_color_codes` to re-assign the single letter color codes by default

- Fixed :func:`jointplot`/:class:`JointGrid` and :func:`regplot` so that they now accept list inputs.

- Fixed a bug in :class:`FacetGrid` when using a single row/column level or using ``col_wrap=1``.

- Changed :func:`rugplot` to plot a matplotlib ``LineCollection`` instead of many ``Line2D`` objects, providing a big speedup for large arrays.

- Added the ``subplot_kws`` parameter to :class:`PairGrid` for more flexibility.

- Enhanced :func:`color_palette` to accept a parameterized specification of a cubehelix palette in in a string, prefixed with ``"ch:"`` (e.g. ``"ch:-.1,.2,l=.7"``). None that keyword arguments can be spelled out or referenced using only their first letter, except reversing the palette is accomplished by appending ``"_r"`` as with other matplotlib colormaps. This specification will be accepted by any seaborn function with a ``palette=`` parameter.

- Changed the default diagonal plots in :func:`pairplot` to use `func`:kdeplot` when a ``"hue"`` dimension is used.

- Changed the default off-diagonal plots to use :func:`scatterplot`. (Note that the ``"hue"`` currently draws three separate scatterplots instead of using the hue semantic of the scatterplot function.

- Changed color handling when using :func:`kdeplot` with two variables. The default colormap for the 2D density now follows the color cycle, and the function can use ``color`` and ``label`` kwargs, adding more flexibility and avoiding a warning when using with multi-plot grids.

- Removed a special case in :class:`PairGrid` that defaulted to drawing stacked histograms on the diagonal axes.

- Fixed functions that set axis limits so that they preserve auto-scaling state on matplotlib 2.0.

- Avoided an error when using matplotlib backends that cannot render a canvas (e.g. PDF).

- Changed the install infrastructure to explicitly declare dependencies in a way that ``pip`` is aware of. This means that ``pip install seaborn`` will now work in an empty environment. Additionally, the dependencies are specified with strict minimal versions.

- Updated the testing infrastructure to execute tests with `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/>`_ (although many individual tests still use nose assertion).
