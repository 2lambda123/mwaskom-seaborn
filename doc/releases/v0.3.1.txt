v0.3.1 (??)
-----------

This is a minor release from 0.3 with fixes for several bugs.

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed an issue where the support for kernel density estimates was sometimes computed incorrectly.

- Fixed a problem where ``hue`` variable levels that were not strings were missing in FacetGrid legends.

- When passing a color palette list in a ``with`` statement, the entire palette is now used instead of the first six colors.
