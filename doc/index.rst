Seaborn: statistical data visualization
=======================================

Seaborn is a Python visualization library based on matplotlib. Its primary
goal is to provide a concise, high-level interface for drawing statistical
graphics that are both informative and attractive.

For a brief introduction to the ideas behind the package, you can read the :ref:`introductory notes <introduction>`.

Much more detail about the kind of problems seaborn is useful for can be found in the in-depth :ref:`tutorials <tutorials>`. Or, you can browse the public :ref:`API reference <api_ref>` to see what kind of tools are available.
