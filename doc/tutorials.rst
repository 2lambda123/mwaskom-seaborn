Tutorial notebooks
==================

There are a few tutorial notebooks that offer some thoughts on visualizing
statistical data in a general sense and show how to do it using the tools that
are provided in seaborn. The notebooks are meant to be fairly, but not completely
comprehensive; hopefully the docstrings for the specific functions will answer
any additional questions.
