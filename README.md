Seaborn: statistical data visualization
=======================================

Seaborn is a library of high-level functions that facilitate making informative
and attractive plots of statistical data using matplotlib. It also provides
concise control over the aesthetics of the plots, improving on matplotlib's
default look.

Examples
--------

There are a few tutorial notebooks that offer some thoughts on visualizing
statistical data in a general sense and show how to do it using the tools that
are provided in seaborn. They also serve as the primary test suite for the package.
The notebooks are meant to be fairly, but not completely comprehensive;
hopefully the docstrings for the specific functions will answer any additional
questions.

Installation
------------

To install the released version, just do

    pip install -U seaborn

However, I update the code pretty frequently, so you may want to clone the
github repository and install with

    pip install -r requirements.txt

from within the source directory.
